Slug:
if i click on tshirt1 , the urls look like:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/1/tshirt/
This what the slug doing,explain:

URL Example:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/1/tshirt/

    1: This is the unique identifier (id) of the product. It's the primary key from the database.
    
    tshirt: This is the slug, a URL-safe representation of the product name.

    
Purpose of the Slug

    Readability: The slug makes the URL easier to read and understand for users (e.g., tshirt instead of product?name=Tshirt).
    SEO Optimization: Including meaningful keywords (like product names) in the URL improves search engine rankings.
    Uniqueness: Slugs are unique per product or category, ensuring no conflicts in URLs.

    
How Itâ€™s Working

>>>>In Your Product Model:

slug = models.SlugField(max_length=250)
This defines the slug field, which is stored in the database for each product.



>>>>In the get_absolute_url Method:

def get_absolute_url(self):
    return reverse('storeapp:product_detail', kwargs={'id': self.id, 'slug': self.slug})

This method dynamically generates the URL for a product using its id and slug.



>>>>In Your Templates (list.html):

<a href="{% url 'storeapp:product_detail' product.id product.slug %}">
The URL tag uses the id and slug to create the link.


>>>Result:
When you click on a product (e.g., "Tshirt1"):

    Django looks for the product using the id and slug in the database.
    The view (product_detail) fetches the product and displays its details.
    The URL becomes http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/1/tshirt/, where:
        1 is the product's ID.
        tshirt is its slug.

'''
Reason for Using ForeignKey:
1. Relationship Between Categories and Products:
    Each product must belong to one category
    Each category can have many products
    This is a one-to-many relationship, which is naturally modeled with a ForeignKey.

2.Database Design:
The ForeignKey creates a column in the (pgadmin) Product table that stores a reference (ID) of each product like Tshirt2 is category 1, shoe1 is category 4 etc
to the related Category table.

3.By using on_delete=models.CASCADE, deleting a category automatically deletes all its related products,
